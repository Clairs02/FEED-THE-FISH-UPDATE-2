The file /multiplayer-fish-game/multiplayer-fish-game/public/sounds/win.wav is intended to be an audio file. As such, I cannot generate the contents of an audio file directly in text format. You would typically create or obtain a .wav file using audio editing software or sound libraries.

Please ensure that you have a suitable audio file named "win.wav" in the specified directory.
